# CSE332-Data-Visualization-Project-Fall-2020
Final lab for my Data Visualization class--CSE 332, at Stony Brook University.
This dataset gives the most-streamed Spotify songs of the 2010s.
I aimed to uncover WHY these songs garnered the most streams, in typical visualization fashion.
I used Python, specifically Plotly, in combination with Dash to create a simple HTML dashboard.
